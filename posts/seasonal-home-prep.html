            <h2>Start with Air and Allergens</h2>
            <p>
              Replace HVAC filters, vacuum vents, and clean humidifiers or air
              purifiers. Open windows for 15 minutes to circulate fresh air
              while temperatures are mild. If you have allergy concerns, wash
              curtains and wipe baseboards to remove hidden dust and pollen.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Check for mold or moisture in bathrooms and around windows.
              </li>
              <li>
                Clean ceiling fans and light fixtures that collect allergens.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add air-friendly houseplants like spider plants or peace lilies.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Rotate Wardrobes and Linens</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Declutter closets before storing last season's clothing; donate
                what no longer fits or is unused.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wash blankets with a hypoallergenic detergent before packing
                away or putting fresh ones on beds.
              </li>
              <li>
                Store items in labeled, breathable bins to prevent musty odors
                and make next season's switch easy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Swap throw pillow covers, curtains, and rugs for lighter or
                warmer versions to update your space quickly.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Pet and Child Considerations</h3>
            <p>
              Wash pet bedding and check that their spaces are comfortable for
              changing temperatures. For young children, make sure seasonal
              clothing, bedding, and outdoor gear fit well and are easy to
              access.
            </p>
            <div class="article-highlight">
              <h3>Family Safety Moment</h3>
              <p>
                Test smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and review your
                emergency contact list. Keep a small kit with flashlights,
                batteries, and first aid supplies near the entryway. Store cold
                weather or storm gear where everyone can find it quickly.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Create Weekly Maintenance Zones</h3>
            <p>
              Assign each weekend to a specific space: kitchen, garage,
              bedrooms, outdoor areas. Short, consistent sessions simplify large
              chores and prevent overwhelm.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Kitchens: Clean refrigerator coils and pantry shelves; toss
                expired food.
              </li>
              <li>
                Garage or sheds: Store or service seasonal tools such as lawn
                mowers or snow shovels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Outdoor: Trim plants, inspect gutters, and check playground or
                patio safety.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bedrooms: Flip mattresses, check for signs of pests, and dust
                underneath furniture.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Plan for Safety and Comfort with the Weather</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Spring/Summer:</strong> Check window screens, stock up
                on allergy meds, and set up fans or portable AC units.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Autumn/Winter:</strong> Inspect heating systems, seal
                drafts, and restock cozy essentials like blankets and hot water
                bottles.
              </li>
              <li>
                Update your home emergency plan for power outages or storms; run
                a quick fire or exit drill with kids.
              </li>
            </ul>
